# üéÆ Mastermind CLI

Welcome to **Mastermind CLI**, a command-line version of the classic strategy game Mastermind. In this game, you can play as either a **Code Breaker** or a **Code Maker**, challenging yourself or letting the computer do the thinking!

## ‚ú® Features

- **Two Play Modes:**
  - **Code Breaker:** Crack the computer-generated code in 10 moves or less.
  - **Code Maker:** Create your own 4-digit code and let the computer try to break it in 5 moves or fewer.
- **ü§ñ AI-Driven Guessing:** The computer uses a sophisticated minimax algorithm inspired by Donald Knuth's method to efficiently guess the code.
- **üíª Command-Line Interface:** Simple and easy-to-use interface for an engaging experience.

## üéÆ How to Play

You can play Mastermind CLI either on Replit or locally on your machine.

### Play on Replit

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### Code Breaker Mode

- The computer generates a secret 4-digit code.
- You have 10 moves to guess the code.
- After each guess, you'll receive hints to help narrow down your options.

### Code Maker Mode

- You create a 4-digit code.
- The computer uses a minimax algorithm to break your code in 5 moves or less.
